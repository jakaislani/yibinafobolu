This is great news for those who don’t live by an ocean or lake to experience “polar plunges”, or don’t want to spend the money on a wellness studio membership in order to have access to an ice bath.</p><h2>The benefits of ice baths</h2><p>Though the physical and mental health benefits that people experience from cold-water immersion are entirely unique to each individual and not exactly a foolproof cure-all for everyone, research indicates deliberate cold exposure can benefit the human body and mind.</p><p><span class="inline text-h5 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><a v-on:click.prevent="trackLinkGA($event, key)" :href=post.url data-url-source=related-content class=related-content__link referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url href=#></a><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-bourgoyne-57608811b>Michael Bourgoyne</a>, DPT, CNS, a physical therapist at Home Health in Salt Lake City, UT, says that a cold plunge is essentially cryotherapy (cold therapy), which is known to induce a parasympathetic response in the body by stimulating the <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/how-stimulate-vagus-nerve/>vagus nerve</a>. That icy jolt to the system can slow your heart rate, lower your blood pressure and cortisol levels, and ultimately, reduce inflammation and stress in the body.</p><p>According to Bourgoyne, after lowering your core body temperature down in an ice bath, your blood vessels work to re-dilate as your body warms back up and readjusts its temperature back to normal levels, thus increasing circulation throughout the body. After a teeth-chattering plunge, you may also notice an invigorating sensation similar to that of a “runner’s high"—<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004210050065 data-type=affiliateLink data-aff-intermediate="https://go.skimresources.com?id=104860X1561639&xs=1&xcust=STMSLS-1043003&url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs004210050065">some studies</a> suggest that a rush of chemicals like dopamine can be triggered by a chilly soak.</p><p>As noted, the benefits can differ from person to person.

He notes the physical benefits, like soothing inflammation and aching muscles, but particularly enjoys the mental benefits of cold plunging, which he describes as a driving force to get him to do something outside of his comfort zone every day.</p><p>“Nothing makes me more uncomfortable than sitting in freezing water and I wanted to build some extra mental fortitude, amongst other things,” he says. “My mental capacity has improved noticeably. Hopping in the cold water first thing in the morning makes anything that comes my way the rest of the day that much easier. Once I hop out, I feel an endorphin rush and am quickly awake and alert to start the day.”</p><p>When Well+Good's associate commerce editor, Francesca Krempa, took <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/ice-barrel-review/>an ice bath every day for two weeks,</a> she noted the opposite—also confirmed icing made a big difference on her body, especially her joints.</p><p>"Ice bathing can be relaxing, when you train up to 30-degree water, of course," she wrote in a review. "And I did feel better, at least physically. While I didn't notice a difference in my anxiety or depression levels, my muscles felt great. My knees particularly felt looser and less angry than they had all winter, particularly on the days when I lasted three minutes or more."</p><p>If you are ready to give it a whirl, these are the best at-home ice baths worth taking the plunge in.</p><h2>9 best at-home ice baths</h2><h2 class="text-[22px] wg-inline-shopable__title mb-[20px]">Best overall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ice-Barrel.jpeg> <a href=# class=wg-inline-shopable__subtitle-link data-type=affiliateLink data-product-name=Ice+Barrel data-product-price-value=1200 data-vars-event="product name" data-vars-info=Ice+Barrel referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel=sponsored data-vars-click-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=2520112&m=106685&afftrack=STMSLS-1043003&urllink=icebarrel.com%2Fproduct%2Fice-barrel%2F" data-aff-intermediate="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=2520112&m=106685&afftrack=STMSLS-1043003&urllink=icebarrel.com%2Fproduct%2Fice-barrel%2F"><p>Ice Barrel — $1,200.00</p></a><p>Easy set up?

As to not completely shock your body, experts recommend starting out with warmer temperatures in the <span>45-55&lt;&lt;°F range before working down to colder temps (35-39°F).</span></p><p>"Gradual cold exposure and listening to the body, never forcing, is the way to build cold tolerance until you are ready to try an ice bath," <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored" data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wimhofmethod.com/instructors/vilhjalmureinarsson referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade>Andri Einarrson</a>, a certified Wim Hof instructor, leads the cold water therapy experience on adventure travel company&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored" data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/leafgroup_ca5e0_wellgood?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D104860X1561639%26%26xs%3D1%26%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.flashpack.com%252Fus%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.www.wellandgood.com%2Fice-barrel-review%2F&event_type=click" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-type=affiliateLink data-aff-intermediate="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/leafgroup_ca5e0_wellgood?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D104860X1561639%26%26xs%3D1%26%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.flashpack.com%252Fus%252F&&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.www.wellandgood.com%2Fice-barrel-review%2F&&event_type=click">Flash Pack’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored" data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.flashpack.com/us/adventure-trips/steamy-iceland/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade>Unknown Iceland trip,</a> previously told us. "What you can do is put cold water (no ice) in your [tub] and see if you manage to be as relaxed as if it was hot water. If not, keep with cold showers until you manage to go into the [tub] in total relaxation."</p><h3>How long should you take an ice bath for?</h3><p>This will also vary from person to person depending on their experience level, threshold, and the temperature of the water. But the colder the stimulus, the shorter amount of time you need to expose yourself to the cold. If it's your time taking an ice bath, <span>If it’s your first time taking an ice bath, it’s often recommended to aim for 1-3 minutes. If the plunge was manageable, you can increase your time (or decrease your temp) next time.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>How much ice do you need for a cold plunge without a chiller?</h3><p>The amount of ice depends on the size of the tub and the temperature you are seeking in your ice bath. For a ballpark, you’ll need about 60-100lbs of ice to get your bath to the desired temp (under 50 degrees).</p><h3>What are some tips to mentally get through a plunge?</h3><p>Like most things, starting is the hardest part. Upon submersion and shock, your body’s fight or flight response will kick in (telling you to get the hell out of there). This is where the true challenge lies: “Mentally getting through a plunge is actually the toughest part for me,” says Klink. “I have had to train my mind to slow down and focus on my breathing. The more you focus on your breathing, taking deep breaths, and focus on staying in the moment, the quicker the time goes. This takes some time to get to a point where you can feel relaxed in the cold water.”</p><h3>When is the best time to take an ice bath?</h3><p>It’s easier said than done, but try to stay consistent and commit yourself to a regular schedule. Like most habits, it will take time and repetition to develop. “My biggest piece of advice is to start with a manageable time duration and water temperature,” says Klink. “You can build on this session after session as you build a tolerance.” Even better, setting goals throughout your cold-plunge journey always makes it a personal challenge to reach/beat, adding even more of a pep in your step as your dry off.</p><p>Well+Good articles reference scientific, reliable, recent, robust studies to back up the information we share.

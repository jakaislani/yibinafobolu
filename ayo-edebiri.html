Her parents encouraged her to study to become a teacher, and she enrolled at New York University. After two years, she began to reconsider her future. She switched her major to dramatic writing and began to perform stand-up comedy at the encouragement of her friend Rachel Sennott. By the time Edebiri graduated from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts in 2017, she was determined to pursue a comedy career.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 title="Early Comedy and TV Writing Career" data-anchor-id=early-comedy-and-tv-writing-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Comedy and TV Writing Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduation, Edebiri remained in New York City and continued to perform stand-up routines.

Happy endings used to be Hollywood cliches; now, if we ever got one, it would almost feel original.</p><p>The story gives us some ordinary high school kids growing up in a pleasant semirural section of Georgia. They drive around in cars and pickup trucks, they go to dances, they study, and when the guys hang around with the guys and the girls hang around with the girls, the subject of conversation is, always and eternally, the mysteries of the opposite sex. Nobody knows much about sex, period, much less the opposite one, but there’s a lot of big talk and an insatiable curiosity.</p><p>Curiosity is satisfied, however, for some of the guys through the friendliness of Billie, a shy, pretty girl who lives with subliterate parents and who is so lacking in self-confidence that she seeks to find acceptance by, as the fine old phrase has it, putting out. Several guys in the school have been with Billie, or say they have, or mean to, or in any event may.</p><p>But not Buster, who is your typical high school jock and a little something more. He knows his own mind, is independent, is admired, and has a much larger measure of compassion than his friends. He’s engaged to marry an insipid girl, the kind who wins the Homecoming Queen title and believes the momentum will carry her straight through life. But Buster becomes intrigued with Billie. He senses something about her that has value; he seems to instinctively understand why she behaves as she does, and (more importantly) why she doesn’t have to.</p><p>Most of the movie is about the love that slowly grows up between them as Buster wins Billie’s trust and helps her to develop self-confidence. The fact that Buster would be seen publicly with Billie (would, indeed, take her to Sunday church) causes indignation within the cliquish high school crowd he runs with, and especially among Billie’s numerous former boyfriends.</p><p>What’s good about the movie_what you’ll remember_are the tender and rather lovely scenes between Buster and Billie, and the strength with which Buster faces down the disapproval of his friends. What doesn’t work, for me, anyway, is the violent and tragic ending. It’s not that the ending isn’t plausible; indeed, as it’s presented, it seems inevitable enough. It’s just that somehow the human values in the film should have been developed more fully, so that at the end we could have some sort of resolution based on changes in the characters, rather than on their violent acts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46brKyslad6orrDZpmipJyesm59mHBr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./demi-bagby.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Demi Bagby Married, Dating, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nixeus-vue-30-30-2560x1600-ips-monitor-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>sRGB Measurements - Nixeus VUE 30: 30&amp;quot; 2560x1600 IPS Monitor Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

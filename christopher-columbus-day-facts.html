Was the man from Genoa a brave explorer or greedy invader? A gifted navigator or reckless adventurer? Here are some facts to consider the next time you hear someone recite, “In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue...”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read His Biography</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Columbus never discovered America but his voyage was no less courageous</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even if you were to overlook the not-so-minor fact that millions of people were already living in the Americas in 1492, the fact is that Columbus never set foot on the shores of North America. In fact, October 12 marks the day of his arrival to the Bahamas. While he did reach the coasts of what today are Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, as well as explore the Central and South American coasts, he never unfurled a Spanish flag in North America. (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/leif-eriksson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Leif Eriksson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Leif Eriksson</a> is the first European believed to have sailed to North America, having reached Canada 500 years before Columbus set sail to the west.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He didn’t reached Asia as planned, but you can’t discount the sheer will required to make his journey. Beginning at the age of 41, he defied naysayers across Europe and led four voyages across an uncharted ocean in wooden sailing ships that weren’t designed to take on the punishing waters of the Atlantic.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Many already believed the world was round</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1492, most educated Europeans already believed the earth was round. In fact, it was an idea that had been established by the ancient Greeks in the 5th century BCE. Contrary to the popular myth, Columbus didn’t set out to prove that the world was round, but rather that it was possible to sail around it, a voyage the explorer drastically underestimated.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He had struck a lucrative deal with the Spanish</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Columbus stood to gain significant wealth and power from his voyage, terms he negotiated with King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella of Spain. His contract with the monarchs, called The Capitulations of Santa Fe, named Columbus the admiral, viceroy, and governor of any land he discovered. It also stated that Columbus could keep 10 percent of any “merchandise, whether pearls, precious stones, gold, silver, spices, and other objects” that he “acquired” within the new territory. Columbus might indeed have had noble intentions when he sailed west, but his agreement with Spain suggests his intentions were far from selfless.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More about Columbus</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He enslaved and mutilated Indigenous peoples</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Columbus first set foot on Hispaniola (what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic), he encountered a population of Indigenous peoples called the Taino. A friendly group, they willingly traded jewelry, animals, and supplies with the sailors. “They were very well built, with very handsome bodies and very good faces,” Columbus wrote in his diary. “They do not carry arms or know them... They should be good servants.” The Indigenous peoples were soon forced into slavery and punished with the loss of a limb or death if they didn’t collect enough gold. Between the European’s brutal treatment and their infectious diseases, within decades, the Taino population was decimated.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He was arrested by the Spanish Government</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1499, the Spanish monarchs got wind of the mistreatment of Spanish colonists in Hispaniola, including the flogging and executions without trial. Columbus, who was governor of the territory, was arrested, chained up, and brought back to Spain. Although some of the charges might have been manufactured by his political enemies, Columbus admitted to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella that many of the accusations were true. Columbus was stripped of his title as governor.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Several European countries had rejected Columbus</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For nearly a decade, Columbus lobbied European monarchs to bankroll his expensive quest to discover a western sea route to Asia. In 1484, he tried unsuccessfully to get support from King John II of Portugal, whose experts believed Columbus had underestimated how far he would need to sail. Three years later, he appealed to King Henry VII of England and King Charles VIII of France but was once again turned down. He was even initially rejected by Spain in 1486, but the Spanish monarchs changed their mind and eventually agreed to fund his trip.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Good or bad, Columbus created a bridge between the old and new world</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In what has become known as the Columbian Exchange, Columbus’ voyages enabled the exchange of plants, animals, cultures, ideas, and, yes, disease between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Once the Europeans were able to reach nearly all parts of the globe, a new modern age would begin, transforming the world forever.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Historical Figures Behind Popular Holidays</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGifoqukpL%2B6ecKuo62topp8pLTRoqqtp6CdsrN5wqijrqWSqsBusMCyZJ%2BZk6nA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./easy-summer-desserts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>30 Easy Summer Desserts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-blackout-experiments-2016.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Blackout Experiments movie review (2016)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

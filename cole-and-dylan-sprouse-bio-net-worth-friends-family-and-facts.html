adorable twins captured the hearts of many with their role as identical twins Zack and Cody on the Disney sitcom series Suite Life of Zack & Cody, which ultimately landed them the big break from their careers.</span></p><p>Just in case you’re one of those who can’t tell each other, Dylan played Zack while Cole portrayed Cody.&nbsp;However, their Disney days are behind them now as the once teen idols have now come of age and hope to match their Disney exploits in Hollywood.</p><h2><span>Cole and Dylan Sprouse Bio</span></h2><p><span>Cole Mitchell Sprouse and Dylan Thomas Sprouse were born on August 4, 1992 in Arezzo, Tuscany, a region in central Italy.&nbsp;Teaching jobs had brought their American parents Matthew Sprouse and Melanie Wright to Europe.&nbsp;However, they do not live there long.</span></p><p><span>Four months after their birth, the entire family returned to their native Long Beach, California.&nbsp;Four more months were needed before the boys began their careers in show business, at the suggestion of their grandmother who taught acting.</span></p><p><span>Dylan and Cole began appearing in diaper commercials before moving onto television.&nbsp;Due to California child labor laws, which prohibit children from being filmed beyond a specific time per day, Dylan and Cole, like most twin children, adopted the alternative method of playing the same role interchangeably, saving time.</span></p><p>Their first television role was in Grace Under Fire where they both played the lead role of Patrick Kelly for 72 episodes.&nbsp;This role ended in 1998 and the boys would play a small role in two episodes of Mad TV.</p><p><span>They made their first feature film appearance playing the single role of Julian McGrath in Big Daddy (1999) which also starred Adam Sandler.&nbsp;The film thrust the boys into the limelight as they received numerous nominations but sadly did not win any.</span></p><p><span>For the next few years, the boys barely made progress, scoring guest appearances and a couple of straight-to-video movies.&nbsp;However, the roles eventually prepared them for their break which came in 2005 in Zack & Cody’s Suite Life at Disney.</span></p><p><span>Also Read: Dove Cameron Before Plastic Surgery, Height, Feet, Net Worth, Bio</span></p><p><span>The sitcom was an instant hit, making them Disneystars and members of the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, an 11-member group.&nbsp;During the show, the boys took on other roles, including roles.</span></p><p><span>The brothers reprized their roles in the version of the show titled The Suite Life on Deck.&nbsp;The changes did not detract from the success of the series, which became the most-watched television show between children and children in 2008 and 2009.</span></p><p>They also starred in The Suite Life Movie, released in March 2011, as well as other Disney Original movies including Hannah Montanna, Wizards of Waverly Place and I’m in the Band.</p><p><span>After the sitcom ended in 2011, the twin brothers decided to take a break to focus on their education.&nbsp;They enrolled at New York University, where they graduated in 2015. Cole studied photography, while Dylan focused on video game editing.</span></p><p><span>They both got back into action.&nbsp;Cole portrays series regular role Jughead Jones on the CW sitcom Riverdale.&nbsp;The role earned him his first-ever award, a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actor: Drama.</span></p><p><span>However, Dylan deliberately chose to remain subtle in acting.&nbsp;Recent acting films include Dismissed, the independent film, Carte Blanche and the independent comedy Banana Split.&nbsp;He also had a role in the Brooklyn theater production, The Illuminati Ball.</span></p><p><span>Dylan chose to focus on his love for video games.&nbsp;He played a character in RPG and is working on his own animated fantasy series project.&nbsp;He also plays Dungeons & Dragons in a YouTube/Twitch web series.&nbsp;Dylan has also branched out into the business world.&nbsp;Along with two partners, he plans to open All-Wise Meadery in Brooklyn, NY.</span></p><h2><span>Net worth: $16 million</span></h2><p><span>During their days playing Zack and Cody, Cole and Dylan were twice, in 2007 and 2010, named the richest kids alive.&nbsp;With a combined earning of $40,000 per episode, they are also Disney TV’s highest paid teenage cast.</span></p><p><span>Their success with the series spawned the Sprouse Bros brand which they created in conjunction with Olsen Twins’ Dualstar Entertainment.&nbsp;The brand’s merchandise included comic book series, clothing lines, magazines, and more.&nbsp;The franchise was discontinued in 2008 with only the clothing line left.&nbsp;However, in March 2011, the clothing line was also discontinued.</span></p><p><span>Also Read: Bradley Steven Perry, Age, Sisters, Girlfriend, Sabrina Carpenter, Height</span></p><p><span>The twin brothers have a combined net worth of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>$16 million</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;In 2012, they bought their family a new home in Calabasas, California.</span></p><h2><span>girlfriends</span></h2><p><span>The Sprouse brothers both romanticized a number of women in the entertainment scene.&nbsp;Cole started dating Bree Morgan in 2013. They had met at NYU.&nbsp;However, they broke up in 2015. In 2017, he started dating his Riverdale co-star Lili Reinhart.&nbsp;Click here to see photos from their Hawaii getaway in January 2018.</span></p><p>Like his twin, Dylan didn’t fail to do the love department either.&nbsp;In 2014, he struck up a serious relationship with model Dayna Frazer.&nbsp;They frequently shared photos of each other on their respective Instagram accounts.</p><p><span>However, in August 2017, all hell broke loose when Dayna took to Twitter to reveal that she had found out Dylan had cheated on her.&nbsp;She wasted no time in erasing all traces of Dylan from her social activities.</span></p><p><span>However, Dylan responded in a series of tweets explaining that fans shouldn’t jump to conclusions based on the limited information they have about the cheating issue.&nbsp;He did not deny cheating, but called the case complicated.</span></p><h2><span>Cole and Dylan Sprouse Facts</span></h2><p><span>Cole was named after jazz singer and pianist Nat King Cole, while Dylan was named after Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.</span></p><p><span>Dylan is 15 minutes older than Cole.</span></p><p><span>Cole is taller than Dylan;&nbsp;Dylan Sprouse Height: 1.8m (5ft 11in), Cole Sprouse Height: 1.82m (6ft).</span></p><p><span>In 2013, Dylan was spotted working at a restaurant in New York.&nbsp;Rumors began to swirl that he took the job because he squandered his Disney wealth.&nbsp;However, Dylan immediately debunked them, explaining that he took the job to “primarily feed my excessive video game addiction” and to “try a new experience”.</span></p><p>The Sprouse brothers know how to roast themselves.&nbsp;Give them a Twitter follow for this good sibling fight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGibn6Gybq3NnWSdsZyWu26%2Fz6umrquVYq%2Bqu4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMn6minZ6ZwG6ywKagpbFdlrulecWamq2rXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gemini.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Celebrities with Gemini Zodiac Sign</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./arthur-treacher.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Arthur Treacher</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

In 1982, Lagasse replaced Paul Prudhomme as executive chef of the famed New Orleans restaurant Commander’s Palace. This demanding position, which required Lagasse to work 18 hours a day, put a strain on his marriage. Lagasse and his wife divorced in 1986, at which time Elizabeth and their two children moved back to Massachusetts.</p><p>After seven and a half years at Commander’s Palace, Lagasse opened his first restaurant, Emeril’s, in 1990. Located in New Orleans’ underdeveloped Warehouse District, the menu fused elements of French, Spanish, Caribbean, Asian and Lagasse’s native Portuguese cuisine. Immediately well received by patrons and critics, Emeril’s was named Best New Restaurant of the Year by Esquire magazine. In 1992, riding on the heels of Emeril’s success, Lagasse opened a second establishment, NOLA (an acronym for New Orleans, Louisiana).

Later that year, his growing popularity caught the eye of executives at cable television’s fledgling Food Network.

Capitalizing on the popularity of Emeril Live!, the Food Network took the show to cities like Philadelphia and Chicago, where Lagasse drew arena-sized crowds.</p><p>In 2000, an episode filmed in Las Vegas featured a young couple taking their wedding vows while Lagasse stood by as best man. Although popular among viewers, many culinary writers denounced Lagasse’s theatrical displays, deeming his antics to be flamboyant, devoid of substance, and more entertainment than instruction.

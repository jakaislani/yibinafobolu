A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clip detailing her “crime of fashion”</a> currently boasts 7 million views on TikTok.</p><p>“So yeah just experienced getting dress coded at disney,” reads the caption to the clip, which was uploaded Sunday by user Tori&nbsp;Cannella, 23.</p><p>The incriminating clip shows the Disney visitor strolling through the Orlando theme park’s Magic Kingdom while wearing denim cutoff shorts. Up top, she rocks a long-sleeve black crop top fastened with just two sets of leather ties that barely conceals her bosom.</p><p>The footage concludes with the guest following an employee to a store, where she was gifted a complimentary Walt Disney tee to wear over her allegedly not-safe-for-park apparel. It was one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney’s 2020 Retro T-Shirts</a>, which reportedly go for $24.99.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A Florida Disney World visitor claims she was flagged by cast members for wearing an inappropriate top.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Disney World prohibits “clothing which, by nature, exposes excessive portions of the skin that may be viewed as inappropriate for a family environment.” <span class=credit>TikTok/@toragrams</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Cannella was gifted a complimentary Walt Disney tee to wear over her not-safe-for-park apparel. <span class=credit>TikTok/@toragrams</span></figure><p>This penalty was especially light since Disney World “reserves the right to deny admission to or remove any person wearing attire that is considered inappropriate or attire that could detract from the experience of other Guests,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">per the site</a>.</p><p>Disney defines “inappropriate” couture as clothing with obscene language or graphics, excessively torn garments, objectionable tattoos and attire that touches or drags on the ground. They also prohibit “clothing which, by nature, exposes excessive portions of the skin that may be viewed as inappropriate for a family environment.”</p><p>Meanwhile, “clothing with multiple layers is subject to search upon entry,” according to the guidelines.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“So yeah just experienced getting dress coded at Disney,” Tori Cannella wrote in the clip. <span class=credit>Instagram/@toragrams</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Cannella was penalized for rocking a crop top that revealed her midriff and was partially open in front. <span class=credit>Instagram/@toragrams</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">In retrospect, Cannella admits she probably deserved to be penalized for her fashion faux pas. <span class=credit>Instagram/@toragrams</span></figure><p>In retrospect, Cannella admits she probably deserved to be penalized for her fashion faux pas: “I mean, I kinda agree w[ith] them looking back at this video,” she wrote in the caption.</p><p>However, the guest claimed in the comments that the cast member who put her under House of Mouse arrest was “not very sweet about it,” postulating that she could’ve been in a “bad mood” or “had it out for her.”</p><p>“The lady who gave me the voucher was nice tho!” Cannella wrote. “No hard feelings just thought.”</p><p>The TikTok commentariat found the dress code violation a bit Mickey Mouse.</p><p>“I’m sorry but they reached with this one,” sympathized one defender. “There is nothing wrong with your original top. I’ve seen so much worse.”</p><p>“That’s literally probably one of the least revealing crop tops you could wear . . . at least the shirt was free,” wrote another.</p><p>“I’d get dress coded on purpose so I can get a free shirt,” quipped one TikTok Mouseketeer.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">After Cannella was informed of her dress code violation, she received a voucher for a free T-shirt to be worn while at the theme park. <span class=credit>TikTok/@toragrams</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Disney World “reserves the right to deny admission to or remove any person wearing attire that is considered inappropriate or attire that could detract from the experience of other Guests,” per the site. <span class=credit>TikTok/@toragrams</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">They put her under blouse arrest. <span class=credit>TikTok/@toragrams</span></figure><p>However, others sided with the Disney fashion police with one critic writing, “It’s not a ‘bad’/’showy’ crop top but I could see them wanting you to wear something else in case you went on rides and accidentally flashed an 8yo.”</p><p>“I mean.. valid. wear what you want but going on a coaster your girls are gonna fly out lol,” theorized another.</p><p>In a similar sartorial fiasco in June, a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Disney World visitor claims cast members </a>forced her to don a gift shop T-shirt because her strappy, cropped top wasn’t “appropriate.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xma2xfm7mwvsidmGavn6Kur3nFpZign5WZeqe70WaunpminruoecinmKmooqS9s7XArZxmrJ%2BleqLAjJ2grKaVrnq4u9Glm2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heidi-rhoades-net-worth-know-about-her-partner-children-and-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heidi Rhoades Net Worth: Know About Her Partner, Children and Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./esteban-ahn.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Esteban Ahn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

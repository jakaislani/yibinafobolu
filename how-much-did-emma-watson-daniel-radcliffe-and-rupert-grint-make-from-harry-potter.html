Child stars are often subjected to such an extensive amount of scrutiny, expectation, and whiplash that they tend to fade with the memory of their fame. However, nothing could be farther from the truth for Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, who’ve all gone on to lead successful lives beyond Potter, both in front of the camera and behind it, professionally as much as personally.&nbsp;Somehow, unlike Nearly Headless Nick, they walked away from it all with their head firmly fastened on their shoulders.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Most recently, Radcliffe wowed audiences with his portrayal of Weird Al in Weird: The Al Yankovic Story in 2022. Grint has been hard at work starring in M. Night Shyamalan’s Apple TV series Servant as well as his feature film Knock at the Cabin in 2023. Meanwhile, Watson has been laying low after a steady stream of acting work that saw her in Beauty and the Beast and the Oscar-winning Little Women; she focuses much of her time nowadays on activism and fighting for equality.</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>It goes without question, however, that the lives these three actors live are thanks in large part to the success of Harry Potter. Were it not for the experience it offered or the financial freedom it provided, they could have traversed down entirely different paths, leaving us none the wiser to their exceptional talent. That of course begs the question of how much money they earned while on Harry Potter. How much exactly did each of them pocket on their way to superstardom? Surely, a decent amount?</p><h2 id=h-how-much-did-rupert-grint-make-from-harry-potter data-injectable=false>How much did Rupert Grint make from Harry Potter?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Rupert-Grint-Ron-Weasly-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets.jpg><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=799 data-injectable=true>Rupert Grint’s earnings from the first four Harry Potter films are unknown, with the earliest record of income arriving only after Order of the Phoenix, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The fifth installment reportedly offered Grint $4 million, indicating he likely received somewhere close to $1 million if not more for the previous three movies.

Likewise, she also received $30 million for both Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Her leading role in Beauty and the Beast scored the actress a substantial chunk of change, thanks in large part to the publicity her name provided, earning her $15 million.

For Chamber of Secrets, he made $3 million, for Prisoner of Azkaban he made $6 million, and for Order of the Phoenix, he made $14 million. However, none of that compared to what he’d go on to make for the final three films of the franchise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince reportedly earned Radcliffe the sum of the first five movies combined, totaling $24 million.

Renner was spotted out with a brunette woman at a star-studded event in Los Angeles Wednesday night.</p><p>Although some outlets reported that the mystery woman was the “Bourne Legacy” star’s ex-wife, Sonni Pacheco — with whom he’s <a href=#>had a bitter custody battle</a> — Page Six can confirm that his date was not the sculptor.</p><p>Pacheco, who <a href=#>welcomed her second child</a> and first baby with retired NHL player Nate Thompson in March, is sporting a much lighter hairdo these days, according to social media posts.</p><p>Renner’s unidentified plus-one bears a striking resemblance to the artist but has much darker locks and eyes.</p><p>We’re told the “Avengers: Endgame” star and his guest spent the entire night together at the opening of Level 8, an entertainment experience that features eight different venues, including two bars, three restaurants, two casual dining spots and one nightclub.</p><p>“They looked friendly,” an eyewitness tells Page Six exclusively of the duo. “I don’t think that they were romantic, but they were together the majority of the evening to the point that they went to a nightclub in that same area and they were together at the table.”</p><figure

class=credit>Loamis Media</span></figure><p>The spy also noticed Renner, 52, and his date “whispering pretty closely” to each other throughout the night and shares that they had a “great rapport.”</p><p>They were accompanied by Aaron Paul, his wife, Lauren Paul, and Anderson .Paak.</p><p>We’re told the action star and his lady friend stayed out until anywhere from midnight to 1 a.m.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Renner’s date was initially mistaken for his ex-wife, Sonni Pacheo, seen here alongside the actor and their

days. <span class=credit>sonnipacheco.life/Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">She has had a toxic relationship with Renner for years and recently welcomed a child with former hockey player Nate Thompson (seen here). <span class=credit>nthompson44/Instagram</span></figure><p>A source says Renner had a hotel suite nearby that only featured a king bed and a pull-out couch, though it is unclear whether his gal pal chose to spend the night with him.</p><p>Reps for Renner did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment, but a source later revealed that the gal pal is Lauren Weiss, the wife of David Weiss, who is one of Renner’s close friends.</p><p><strong>For more Page Six you love …</strong></p><p>The “Arctic Dogs” star has a new lease on life after a <a href=#>near-fatal snowplow accident</a> in early January, in which he <a href=#>broke more than 30 bones</a>.</p><p>He has since <a href=#>miraculously recovered</a> and been able to resume his usual activities such as <a href=#>walking a red carpet</a> and <a href=#>hitting up Six Flags</a>.</p><figure

8</span></figure><p>In March, Renner told Diane Sawyer in <a href=#>his first sit-down interview</a> since the incident, “I’ve lost a lot of flesh and bone in this experience, but I’ve been refueled and refilled with love and titanium.”</p><p>The Oscar nominee <a href=#>was married to Pacheco</a>, 32, from January 2014 to December 2015. They share a 10-year-old daughter, Ava.</p><p>After their divorce, the exes were entangled in a nasty and lengthy court battle that saw them fight over everything from <a href=#>child support payments</a> to <a href=#>abuse allegations</a>, the latter of which <a href=#>Renner denied</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmlwaGllZLemvsSmsGaqlaO7pr6MqZirrJmawG7DyK2fZqSfpLhurcuiop5ln5t6psSMrKanpplivaKvx56aqGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-wayne-callies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Wayne Callies Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inquisitor-ghost-petition-grooming-allegations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inquisitor Ghost Petition: Instagram And Allegations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

Hope is quickly diminishing, thanks in large part to Netflix’s reputation for axing <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fantasy</a></strong> favorites, even as Netflix works to throw us for a loop with an unexpected Father’s Day post.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>The fandom behind Warrior Nun, a prime example of Netflix’s vendetta against fantasy, is already well-familiar with the fight Shadow and Bone fans are facing. The robust viewer base still hasn’t given up the fight to see Warrior Nun return, and the cast and crew behind the series have taken notice.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>No Lord of the Rings projects are at risk of getting canceled anytime soon, but a recent bout of lesser-quality projects is starting to wear on the franchise’s fanbase. Thankfully, a few shining gems in the world of gaming continue to maintain the quality we expect from J.R.R. Tolkien’s world, even as news of blatant exploitation dampens hopes for the future.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-there-s-still-hope-for-shadow-and-bone-season-three data-injectable=false>There’s still hope for Shadow and Bone season three</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shadow_and_Bone_season2.jpg><p data-characters=630 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>Hope for a Shadow and Bone renewal has been fading for several months now, as fans of the fantasy adaptation await any news of a season three with bated breath. There are also broad demands for a Six of Crows spin-off, but Netflix has largely remained tight-lipped regarding the expansion of its Grishaverse. A celebratory Father’s Day post just reignited a fire in the fandom, however, after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highlighting Tolya actor</a> Lewis Tan and his father, Phil Tan. While Netflix may well have chosen the actor without a thought for the implications, the Shadow and Bone base drew plenty of conclusions from his brief appearance on Twitter.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>But the development of a fresh series, all while Shadow and Bone fans wait in the wings, diminishes expectations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kaz_Brekker.jpg><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=842 data-injectable=true>Yearning for Shadow and Bone season three was reduced even more by news that, in the time we’ve been impatiently awaiting updates on the show’s future, Netflix has approved, renewed, and started shooting a completely different series. If the streamer has that kind of time, and money, at its disposal, why are we <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still waiting on news of season three</a>? At this point, it’s got to be purposeful, and — considering Netflix’s atrocious reputation when it comes to fantasy — that can’t be good news for fans of the Grishaverse.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>These Lord of the Rings video games put Gollum to shame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lord-of-the-Rings-Gollum-Screenshot-2.png><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>The recent release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum reminded fans of the famous franchise exactly why most video games based on movies or books flop. While the rare exception — like The Witcher — proves the rule wrong, far too many misfires establish the trend as, overall, a failure.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>A few <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">solid Lord of the Rings games</a> exist out there, however, from meticulous recreations of the films and J.R.R. Tolkien’s books to departures from established material that help to flesh out the author’s rich world. You might want to skip Gollum, if you’re looking to enjoy the related games, but don’t sleep on some of the better entries in the franchise.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sylvia De Fanti had a blast making Warrior Nun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warrior-nun-2.jpg><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=false>In an exclusive interview with Mother Superion actress Sylvia De Fanti, we at We Got This Covered learned a lot about the star’s time filming season two, passion for the fans, and hopes for the future. She reportedly had an absolute blast filming the series, and she has high praise for its every element, from its steps forward in representation to its script writing and action sequences. Read the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full interview</a> for yourselves, if you’d like to gain an even deeper appreciation for the ill-fated Netflix show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8uaq56rpGKzorrTmqqyZZ6axLR51pqpq6Gfp3qvwc2sZKyxnKu2onnDnmSfmZ6ptm6%2Fz56YpKtdpMK1ecCsZKGnoJrAbrLOq2SsoJGZvLh5wKebZpqfo7Juv8SaqqimXam1s7HEZqqipptk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-foster-defends-age-gap-with-wife-katharine-mcphee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David Foster defends 34-year age gap with wife Katharine McPhee</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./riley-deluise-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Riley DeLuise Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

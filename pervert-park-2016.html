While speaking with Nancy Morais, who founded Florida Justice Transitions to take care of her son after he became a registered sex offender, she asks them, “Do you think your child is perfect?” “We do,” Frida responds. “But that child grows up," Nancy responds. "Does something bad. Makes a mistake. Just one. Never to be forgiven.”&nbsp;</p><p>The 120 residents of this trailer park in St. Petersburg, Florida have been living that life sentence in harmony, while taking two-year counseling sessions run by a man named Don. We meet offenders of various degrees, from misdemeanors to horrific physical assaults, as they coexist in an American neighborhood that is not run by fear of the other, nor does it seek to punish sex offenders, but treat them so that they can one day become contributors to society. "Pervert Park" is at once the image of a civilization built on understanding, just as much as a critique on an American prison system that dehumanizes criminals to the recidivism rate of 77% (meanwhile, the recidivism at Florida Justice Transitions is less than 1%).&nbsp;</p><p>“Pervert Park” is a full humanization of these men and women. It allows residents to share their life stories and personal tragedies while presenting them as regular folk, walking around their neighborhood on sun-kissed Florida days, having barbecues outside, the traffic of the neighboring world hundreds of feet away but mostly experienced as background noise. Footage of them filling up fishbowls, or building a new house for a new resident—a vivid subtext of containment—is mixed with their close-up interviews, in which they tell us about life during and after the offense that landed them into Florida Justice Transitions. As a viewer, you start to see some patterns in their stories, which often involve cycles passed on, those of abuse at a young age and/or sexual immaturity, and you witness the current state of it—people like Patrick who are traumatized by their own events, sitting in their homes with tears in their eyes when recalling every detail. All lead subjects are shown taking Don's counseling sessions, but "Pervert Park" is catharsis on a grand scale. "I've never told this to nobody," Tracy says, sharing with the world a lifetime of sexual abuse that was followed up with her own disturbing act.&nbsp;</p><p>“Pervert Park” is an extraordinary film in part for how it challenges a documentarian’s decision to put a camera on a crying face like Tracy's, and to hold on it as a type of emotional climax. There's not an inkling of a dramatic jackpot within these powerful moments, captured with the same lack of intrusiveness as when cameras simply follow residents around in B-roll footage.&nbsp;These shattering scenes instead are breakthroughs between the subjects and the audience, incredibly tough minutes that complete the goal of humanization.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46pnKuulafBbrzAq6JmamBmgw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-way-to-make-uncrustables.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Way To Make Uncrustables</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicolas-todt-bio-age-jean-todts-son-net-worth-mother-daughter-kid-raelyn.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicolas Todt Bio, Age (Jean Todts Son) Net Worth, Mother, Daughter, Kid, Raelyn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

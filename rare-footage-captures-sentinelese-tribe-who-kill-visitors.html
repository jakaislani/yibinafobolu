One of the tribesmen responded by firing an arrow at the rescue team.</p><p>In 1967, the Indian government begun making attempts to contact the Sentinelese, led by anthropologist T.N. Pandit, who left the tribe gifts and tried to signal them.</p><p>"Sometimes they would turn their backs to us and sit on their haunches as if to defecate," Pandit remarked of his mission.</p><p>"This was meant to insult us as we were not welcome."</p><p>In March 1970, Pandit's group found themselves cornered in their boats after coming too close to shore. A witness from a different boat reported at the time: "They all began shouting some incomprehensible words. We shouted back and gestured to indicate that we wanted to be friends.</p><p>"The tension did not ease. At this moment, a strange thing happened - a woman paired off with a warrior and sat on the sand in a passionate embrace. This act was being repeated by other women, each claiming a warrior for herself, a sort of community mating, as it were. Thus did the militant group diminish."</p><p>According to the documentary's narrator, there has only been one instance in which outsiders did not face an aggressive reception.</p><p>On January 4, 1991, 28 men, women and children approached Pandit and his group without hostility before retreating into the forest in a gesture he called "incredible".</p><p>Indian authorities have since made it a crime to try to make contact with the Sentinelese.</p><p>It is illegal to go within 5km of the island.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But the waters surrounding the island appear to be under threat by illegal fishermen.</p><p>Survival International reported in 2014 that it had received reports that fishermen were targeting the area, and that seven men had been apprehended by the Indian Coastguard.</p><p>One of the fishermen reportedly stepped foot on the island in close proximity to the tribe's members, and he managed to leave unscathed.</p><p>The group, which advocates for tribal peoples' rights, describes the Sentinelese as "the most vulnerable society on the planet" as they are likely to have no immunity to common diseases such as flu and measles.</p><p>Due to their complete isolation, the chances of them being wiped out by an epidemic are very high, according to the organisation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwvsCrnGaen6TBorPEZpqaqKSqv6a%2FjKycp6yZo7KtsdKeZK2qmZeybsPHqGSkoZyhere10qKrqKqjZJKXmbKFan%2BKfWqmmqShj46NkImAo4qasIeMaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nico-santos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nico Santos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-lord-net-worth-211586.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Lord Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

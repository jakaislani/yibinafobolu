Here’s everything you need to know about American sportscaster’s illness.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-pam-oliver-sick-her-illness-explored></span>Is Pam Oliver Sick? Her Illness Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pam Oliver, 59, has had her fair share of health issues throughout her career. She told Yahoo Sports that she had fibroids “every two years, like clockwork” when she was in her twenties.</p><p>Debilitating migraines that cause vomiting, nausea, and excruciating pain have also plagued Oliver for years, sometimes in the middle of a game. They’ve gotten so bad that she hides out in stadium tunnels to avoid the noise, lights, and pyrotechnics.</p><p>Oliver has taken a proactive approach to migraine treatment, learning progressive muscle relaxation to relieve tension.</p><p>Every month, she also self-administers two shots of medication. “You just jam this thing in your thigh,” she explained as she demonstrated her shots.</p><p>It didn’t help when she was hit in the face with a ball during pregame warmups for the New York Giants-Indianapolis Colts preseason game in 2013 and suffered a concussion. She admitted to taking three to six Excedrin Migraine pills at a time to deal with the pain.</p><p>According to her own estimates, Pam has missed only four games in her 25-plus years with Fox.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pam-oliver-chronic-migraines-health-update></span>Pam Oliver Chronic Migraines & Health Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Previously, Pam Oliver encountered a health problem during an interview with Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones. Suddenly, she did not sound like herself.</p><p>Oliver remained silent about the incident. People made numerous comments about her health or illness. They even speculated that she was intoxicated.</p><p>Some speculated that she might be feeling cold due to the cold weather at Lambeau Field or that she might be extremely ill. Other groups were bullied as a result of her speech.</p><p>Sportscasting stated that she is a migraine sufferer who injects medication into herself when necessary. They speculated that her medication caused her slurring.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-pam-oliver></span>What Happened To Pam Oliver?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pam Oliver was covering a playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and the Los Angeles Rams at Lambeau Field in the cold weather when the incident occurred.</p><p>In the third quarter, she began her report by providing an update on the Packers. Concerns were raised by viewers during her reporting when there were noticeable slurs and sluggishness in her speech.</p><p>While describing the Packers’ strategy to capitalize on Aaron Donald’s absence on the field, she had difficulty pronouncing words like “absences.”</p><p>During her postgame interviews with Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones, she was also seen struggling with these issues. The overall tone of her report was garbled and dissimilar to how she usually sounds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqloryzv4yiqmaokaJ6sLjIr5yrZaOesKx5x56pZqGcobumv9JmmqGqn6O2pHnMop6rmZmjsrR5x56YpayYYsKxsMCtnGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clarissa-abrego-net-worth-261598.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Clarissa Abrego Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./717661-molly-brazy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Molly Brazy Net Worth 2023: What Is The Rapper Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

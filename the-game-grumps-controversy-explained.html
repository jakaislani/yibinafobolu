Two friends, Arin Hanson and Dan Avidan, have taken advantage of this new form of entertainment and created their own brand, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Grumps</a></strong>. The two play video games from their couch, and make a decent amount of money doing so.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately with streaming, there are occasionally some things that happen that are not the best looks ever. One controversy that has fans wanting to know more was the Leadfoot Doxing incident. What exactly happened with this incident?</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-during-the-leadfoot-doxing-incident data-injectable=false>What happened during the Leadfoot Doxing incident?</h2><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Back in 2015, while the pair were playing the game Sonic Adventure, there was a moment in which the team had to read a walkthrough. This walkthrough was designed to help players find three different emerald pieces that would be used. Unfortunately, the pair did not think that the walkthrough was useful and got incredibly upset and angry at it, despite the attempt to help. The goal was not to give the exact location away, but to give hints and advice.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Dan then named the creator of the walkthrough during a livestreamed event. He then took it a step further and commented that, “If he gets a wave of hate from our fans, I would not be surprised.” After Dan said this, the fans of the group took matters into their own hands and went after the person who was just trying to help.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>After the matter of the situation became clear to Dan, he apologized to the person who he had gone after, and the person accepted his apology. After the apology was given and received, the pair took the video down and then censored the name of the person. What makes this look awful for Dan and Arin is that they recently denied that this interaction ever took place, while there is video evidence to clearly support the fact that it indeed did.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>This is not the only time that the pair has had to go through some sort of controversy. The pair have had so many issues in the past that one person took to Reddit and created an entire <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> going through all of their controversies. Hopefully the pair has learned to just stream in peace and enjoy their jobs, as there are many people who would trade places with them in an instant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXZyurrGMoKmupaCoeqS7za2pqK6Vp8C6ecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-watch-all-the-librarian-movies-in-order.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to watch all The Librarian movies in order</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./judy-blume-seemingly-incapable-of-just-enjoying-her-money-comes-out-as-terf.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Judy Blume, seemingly incapable of just enjoying her money, comes out as TERF</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

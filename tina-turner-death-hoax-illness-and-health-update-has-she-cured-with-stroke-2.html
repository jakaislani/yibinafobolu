What’s Love Got to Do with It, which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became her first and only number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100, was featured on her multi-platinum 1984 album Private Dancer.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Turner was instated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.

Weird Al, also regarded as a “musical comedian,” is best renowned for writing songs that make people laugh. Weird Al Yankovic has published almost 150 original songs since the beginning of his career.</strong></p><p>He is a commercially successful artist, with over 12 million albums sold worldwide. Six of his albums have been certified platinum. Yankovic is most known for his humorous music videos, which he directs and uploads on YouTube.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Weird Al Yankovic?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Weird Al Yankovic</a> was born in Downey, California on October 23, 1959. Al’s father always pushed him as a child to “do for a living whatever makes you happy.” Yankovic took his first accordion instruction just before turning seven. Al’s love of music would develop from his initial interest in this instrument. After three years, Al Yankovic began teaching himself how to play the accordion and rock ‘n’ roll music by listening to Elton John tunes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At a young age, he was inspired by comedians such as Frank Zappa, Shel Silverstein, and Spike Jones. Yankovic began kindergarten a year early and finished high school two years ahead of his classmates. During his high school years, he participated in plays and clubs such as the National Forensic League and the “Volcano Worshippers Club.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many businesses does Weird Al Yankovic own?</h2><p>Al Yankovic began his career as a 16-year-old on Dr. Demento’s radio show when the radio presenter played the teen’s taped recordings of many parody songs. During this time, he also began to perform at local coffee shops on the accordion, playing songs like 2001: A Space Odyssey’s theme. Yankovic first became known as “Weird Al” while studying architecture at Cal Poly and working as a DJ for the school’s radio station. Yankovic’s nickname was really a negative label bestowed upon him by his classmates, but he decided to “take it on professionally.”</p><p>Since having a comedic song played on The Dr. Demento Radio Show in 1976 at the age of 16, Yankovic has sold over 12 million albums (as of 2015), released over 150 parodies and original songs, and performed over 1,000 live events. His work has garnered him five Grammy Awards and 11 nominations, as well as four gold and six platinum recordings in the United States. In 2006, nearly three decades into his career, he released his first top-ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (“White & Nerdy”). Mandatory Fun (2014) became his first number-one album within its first week of release.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Weird Al joined Michael J.

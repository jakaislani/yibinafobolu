The genre is certainly rising in popularity among <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anime</a> fans, as series like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!</a> introduce otome tropes to newcomers.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Among English-speaking audiences, otome games have a reputation for being cheesy, simple dating sims about falling head over heels for boys. Neither of these assumptions are true. Over the genre’s 30 year history, otome has embraced more than just girl-meets-boy fairytale weddings. The medium’s dismissal from mainstream conversations largely comes down to backlash against its indulgent fantasies for teen girls and young adult women.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>So what are otome games, if not just games for girls about dating boys? And what makes them different from other visual novels or dating sims? We’ve got everything you need to know about otome’s history, notable entries, and recommendations below.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What does ‘otome’ mean?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aNGELIQUE-lUMINARIS.jpg><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Otome games are romance games made with young women in mind as the core target audience. Like shojo, otome audiences range from teens to young adults. Not every otome game is made by women, but many notable entries are.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-an-otome-game data-injectable=false>What is an otome game?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Otome games are romance games made with young women in mind as the core target audience. Like shojo, otome audiences range from teens to young adults. Not every otome game is made by women, but many notable entries are, including the genre’s iconic&nbsp;Neoromance&nbsp;franchise</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>Emerging in the ’90s, otome borrows heavily from retro shojo manga, down to character archetypes and plot tropes. Otome games can be set anywhere, but often pull from fantasy and historical fiction settings. And while the genre usually focuses on fairytale love stories, more explicit or dramatic titles do exist, not unlike josei (or older adult women’s) manga.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Otome games come in a wide assortment of genres but are most commonly visual novels or dating sims. Some fans of the genre insist that romance is required, though that standard isn’t adhered to by all creators. Many feature stats which alter how other characters interact with the protagonist. And yes, in most otome games, players try to get their desired love interest to fall for them. Traditional otome games feature several different romance paths, and some stories even lean into harem anime tropes to accommodate a larger cast.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Though official English translations are scarce for most releases, English-speaking otome communities regularly provide&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recommendations</a>&nbsp;for which contemporary games fans should seek out. Over 2,600 otome games exist according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Visual Novel Database</a>, including nearly two dozen titles still planned for 2021.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>Otome is just as prone to satire and parody too. One of the most famous includes PigeoNation Inc’s 2011&nbsp;Hatoful Boyfriend: A School of Hope and White Wings, the so-called pigeon dating sim. The game’s 2014 rerelease remains one of the most popular visual novels on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Importantly, yaoi (or boys’ love) games generally fall outside the scope of otome despite their many similarities. Otome games feature a female character as the protagonist, often existing as a blank slate for the player, whereas BL focuses more on gay male pairings. Granted, BL and otome games’ audiences often intersect, in part because both genres feature indulgent fantasies popular among young women.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where did the genre come from?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Angelique-1994-otome-game.jpg><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>What is now considered the first otome game,&nbsp;Angelique, released on the Super Famicom in 1994. The game follows Angelique Limoges, a high school girl who is primed to become a queen.&nbsp;Angelique&nbsp;was originally made for pre-teen girls, but the romance sim quickly proved popular with adolescents and young women.&nbsp;Angelique&nbsp;has since been rereleased several times, seen numerous sequels, and been adapted for manga, anime, and television.</p><h2 id=h-are-all-otome-games-about-women-dating-men data-injectable=false>Are all otome games about women dating men?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Otome romance has long been defined by its male love interests, but that’s not the whole picture. The Visual Novel Database lists <a href=#>121 otome games</a> featuring yuri romance content, of which <a href=#>31 titles </a>have a bisexual protagonist.<a href=#> Seven games</a> are also tagged for explicit depictions of lesbian sex.&nbsp;Yuri may not be a mainstay in most otome games, but it’s certainly part of the genre.</p><p data-characters=696 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>And though it is still an esoteric niche in English-speaking markets, otome has found success among Western anime and manga fans through original English language visual novels. Many of these games are designed for queer women. Love Conquers All Games’ 2016 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ladykiller in a Bind</a>, though much more explicit than conventional otome, maintains its status as one of the most popular lesbian visual novels by and for queer players. Studio Elan, the developers of English yuri VNs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Highway Blossoms</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart of the Woods</a>, recently released a demo for the upcoming release <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Please Be Happy</a>. The game features otome’s traditional gameplay mechanics atop the studio’s saccharine storytelling.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>Other popular otome English visual novels include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cute Demon Crashers!</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Magical Diary</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hustle Cat</a>.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=false>Otome has its own unique place in the history of video games thanks to its women-focused premise and gameplay. The diverse and storied genre has resonated with players around the world for decades and only continues to grow. Interested in giving the genre a shot?

Having played for the college basketball team, Baylor Lady Bears in Waco, Texas, Griner became the only NCAA player to break the record for both men and women for the number of points made and shots blocked, at 3,203 and 736 respectively, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>In February 2022, Griner made headlines for getting detained and arrested by Russian officials for attempting to leave the country while in possession of a vape pen containing hashish oil. Hashish oil is a concentrated liquid that is formed after being extracted from a cannabis plant.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>Since then, the basketball world, and the U.S. at large have fought to get Griner back on U.S. soil. Thankfully, with the help of President Biden, our efforts were successful. On Dec. 8, 2022 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Griner was returned to the U.S.</a> with the caveat that she be traded with Russian arms dealer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Viktor “Merchant of Death” Bout</a>.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Prior to her arrest, Griner enjoyed a vivacious and successful basketball career, raking in the dough from playing in both the U.S. on the Phoenix Mercury team and in Russia on the UMMC Ekaterinburg team. Even though she was being paid considerably less than her male counterparts, Griner acquired quite a hefty chunk of change.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brittney-griner-s-net-worth-explained data-injectable=false>Brittney Griner’s net worth, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by BG (@brittneyyevettegriner)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>According to Time Magazine, Brittney Griner was earning around $1 million a year for playing on the UMMC Ekaterinburg team in Russia. Combined with her $227,900 per year salary from the Phoenix Mercury WNBA team in the U.S., that put her net worth upwards of $5 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>It’s unknown whether Griner will continue playing on the UMMC Ekaterinburg team following her release from the Russian prison. One can reasonably assume the 32-year-old harbors a bit of hesitancy over returning to the country. Because her salary in the U.S. is a fraction of what she was making in Russia, Griner’s net worth will likely not experience the steady climb it saw in previous years.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>That being said, Griner does still have her $1 million deal with Nike. She became the company’s first openly gay athlete back in 2013, something Nike is probably acutely aware of and cognizant of when factoring in any and all future decisions. It’s unlikely that deal is going anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>It’s also safe to assume that given the level of publicity Griner’s Russian imprisonment received, the athlete could be in for a documentary. That is only speculation at this point but it would answer many of the questions her fans and the public have. It’s not a farfetched notion and such an endeavor would line Griner’s pockets quite nicely, adding to her already substantial net worth.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-is-brittney-griner-s-net-worth-related-to-her-russian-imprisonment data-injectable=false>How is Brittney Griner’s net worth related to her Russian imprisonment?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐋𝐄 𝐓.

Griner’s fellow Mercury team member Diana Taurasi does the same, as do Seattle Storm’s forward Breanna Stewart and Connecticut Sun’s center Jonquel Jones, among others. Until the WNBA begins paying its players what they deserve, the practice is likely going nowhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJorqGZpGK2tHnBq6CtrJ6axm6z0aKlnqqjYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-team-l5-lite-3d-sata-ssd-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Entry-Level Price With Mainstream Performance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stranger-things-vr-coming-to-turn-your-home-into-the-upside-down.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stranger Things VR coming to turn your home into the Upside Down</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

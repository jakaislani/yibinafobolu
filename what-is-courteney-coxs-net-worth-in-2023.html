Her impact on the industry is vast, but her legacy goes far deeper than just her career. She’s someone spoken about in high regard, treasured by those who know her, and adored by a fan base for everything from her work ethic to her personality and how she cares for her fans and those closest to her.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>With a filmography as expansive and multifaceted as hers, Cox is without a doubt one of the most well-known names around, leading to her earning quite a bit for the projects she takes on.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-courteney-cox-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>What is Courteney Cox’s net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Courteney Cox (@courteneycoxofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>As reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Cox’s net worth is said to be $150 million, and with a lengthy career and star power in everything from feel-good projects to the spine-tingling, it’s no surprise to her fans.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Some of her earlier roles were in films like Down Twisted, Masters of the Universe, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and in television like Misfits of Science, Family Ties, and The Trouble with Larry; with her breakout roles most definitely being that of Gale Weather in Scream and Monica Geller in Friends.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>As we said above, Cox is an idol for more than just the way she becomes the characters she portrays; she’s adored for the kindness she gives to others. While her portrayal of Gale is one of the most iconic in her history, her time as Monica is what many fans think of when they think of Cox’s history — and she says she learned a lot from the role.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> earlier this year, she said that the series taught her so much and that that time of her life is something she’ll always treasure as immensely special:</p><p>“Friends taught me the importance of camaraderie and really sticking together. These friendships were at the most important time in my life, and we went through so many things together, and it just taught me about being there for each other — I know, that’s the song: ‘I’ll be there for you.’ But it’s true. It was so nice to work with people that could bounce ideas off each other. Everybody wanted the best for everybody. There was no jealousy; it was only, ‘Let’s make the best show we can, and let’s support each other in this.'”</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>This sentiment means more than ever before as fans deal with the heart-wrenching news of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Perry</a>‘s death on Oct. 28, especially in the years since the series ended and each of their lives took such different turns. They always had one another to rely on, having experienced some of the most beautiful pieces of life together.</p><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=false>Cox treasures that time in her life, as well as the other chapters she’s had, and her fans do, too. Most recently, she’s taken on the role of Patricia Phelps in Shining Vale and also serves as a producer on the series. Cox has a massive following on her social channels, where she shares snippets of her life with fans, and everything from adventures with her family to posts of appreciation proves that she’s an actress you just can’t help but love, and we can’t wait to see what’s next for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZOkwrPAxKecsmWTpMW0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnIp2RraGJofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marcia-gay-harden-weight-gain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Did She Look Like?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-y-asi-fue-by-julion-alvarez-y-su-norteno-banda.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: Y As Fue by Julin lvarez y Su Norteo Banda</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

I get it; I will also get into lengthy Reddit threads about<strong> </strong>One Piece. However, if there is one thing that no longer earns debating points, it is the characters’ nationalities.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>During the SBS portion of the volumes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oda has always replied to numerous doubts from fans</a>, including some of the most ludicrous questions you can think of. In one of these instances, a fan questioned the author regarding the Straw Hats’ nationalities if they were to live in the real world, to which Oda promptly answered.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>At that time, his reply was based on each character’s appearance, and in the end, all of the nationalities perfectly matched each character’s personality. On that note, and to correct everyone who thinks our protagonists are Japanese, here are the Straw Hats’ real nationalities.</p><h2 id=h-monkey-d-luffy-brazilian data-injectable=false>Monkey D. Luffy — Brazilian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/luffy-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>According to Oda, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the leader of the Straw Hats</a> would derive from South America, namely, from Brazil. Luffy’s first language would be Portuguese, and his normal attire would surely do justice to the South American country’s weather. Known for its high temperatures in most of its territory, the captain’s open red shirt, blue shorts, and woven sandals — more often known as “waraji” — would be the ideal attire for any Brazilian living in the Southern Hemisphere.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Roronoa Zoro — Japanese</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/zoro-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=true>Perhaps in an unsurprising turn of events, the only Japanese member of the Yonko’s pirates is the right hand of Luffy. According to Oda, Zoro would be Japanese if he lived in our world. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The swordsman’s style was always leaning towards traditional Japanese elements</a>, and while Wano is a nod to Oda’s culture, the Wano outfits just fit Zoro like a glove. Even if bandanas aren’t typical accessories used in Japan, Zoro does wear a “haramaki” underneath his open green jacket, a typical Japanese item of clothing that covers the stomach.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nami — Swedish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nami-one-piece-1.jpg><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>If the Straw Hats’ navigator was from the planet Earth that we know today, she would be from Sweden – according to Oda. The ambitious and strong-willed Nami would be a descendant from the northern regions of Europe, likely obvious from her hair color, which is a far more prominent hue in Northern Europe than in the rest of the continent. Aside from her hair color, Swedes are known for being tall and wealthy. The perfect environment for Nami.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Usopp — African</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/usopp-fishman-island-one-piece.png><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>This time, Oda was a bit vaguer with Usopp than with the rest of the crew. The One Piece author confirmed that the Straw Hats’ sniper is of African descent, even though Oda didn’t specify the country. It appears that Usopp is the only black and African member of the crew – though Brook’s race and ethnicity have long been a topic of discussion. However, he is the second confirmed character hailing from Africa.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Vinsmoke Sanji — French</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sanji-one-piece-whole-cake.png><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>In an unsurprising turn of events, Sanji – was he not living in the fictional world – would be French. Although the cook sports bright blond hair, his twirly eyebrows and goatee point at a much more stereotypical image of a Frenchman. The Western European country is often seen as the birthplace of love, and unmatched gastronomy. Coincidentally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanji’s love for food, and most of all, for romance</a> (read: women) are part of his many traits. On a fun note, the French also have a reputation for being smokers – much like our favorite cook.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tony Tony Chopper — Canadian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chopper-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>From being the Straw Hats’ pet to their unbelievably genius doctor, Chopper can now add “Canadian” to his list of traits. According to Oda, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the anthropomorphic reindeer</a> known for his sweet tooth would derive from the northernmost lands in the North American continent. Much like his own hometown in One Piece, Chopper grew up in a place where cold and snow were the most prevalent weather conditions, making his Human-Human fruit come in handy, as he still has reindeer fur to keep him warm.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nico Robin — Russian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/robin-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=true>Originally from the country of Ohara in the world of One Piece, Robin would come from the cold region of Russia if she lived in the real world that we know today. Robin’s fair skin, with her blue eyes and dark long hair, make up for a very stereotypical image of Eastern European traits, and it is most likely the reason why Oda placed the archeologist as Russian. Interestingly enough, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after the events at Sabaody Archipelago</a>, Kuma sends Robin to a bridge called Tequila World, which is eerily similar to Russian lands.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Franky — American</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/franky-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>Eccentric, and downright bizarre, Franky would quite obviously be from the United States if he lived in the real world. Franky is very obviously inspired by the stereotypical image of American citizens. He is loud and slightly arrogant; his favorite drink is Coca-Cola; he often sports a Hawaiian shirt and he has an obsession with weapons — so that checks out. The shipwright is also known for his constant use of English verbatims for which he is known – Super!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Brook — Austrian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brook-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>The Straw Hats’ musician would, according to the author, originate from Austria. While his appearance doesn’t necessarily allude to the Central European country, Brook’s Austrian roots make sense once taken into consideration with Austria, the European music capital of the 18th and 19th centuries. The country served as the grounds for musical innovation, as well as the birthplace of several famous composers, and where Beethoven and Mozart developed their musical careers. Makes sense.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jinbe — Indian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jinbe-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>One of the most surprising revelations during the SBS quiz was Jinbe’s nationality. As per Oda’s words, the helmsman of the Straw Hats would be Indian, which surprised fans who often tied the Fishman to Japan due to his politeness and standard Japanese attires. However, there are a few reasons why Oda might have chosen India as the helmsman’s origin country, one of them being his race in the One Piece universe. As a Fishman, Jinbe is a Whale Shark, a type of shark often found in the Indian Ocean, justifying his geographical placement.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Eustass Kid – Scottish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Eustass-Kid-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>In an entirely different SBS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">focused on the Supernova</a>, Oda revealed that Kid’s appearance would be remote to Scotland. If Eustass Kid happened to live in our world, he would hail from the northernmost land in the United Kingdom — which makes total sense when you see his red hair. Not that everyone in Scotland has red hair — but you know, it’s a telling sign. His headstrong personality would also perfectly embody the stereotypical image of Scotsman.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>X Drake – Turkish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/X-Drake-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>In the same <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SBS</a> about the Worst Generation, everyone’s favorite anthropomorphic dinosaur is also mentioned. According to Oda, X-Drake is actually Turkish. If you’re confused about this choice, worry not; so were we — so I dug in a little deeper. In certain provinces like Yozgat and Ankara (formerly known as Galatia), there were several Celtic invasions that resulted in the population being comprised heavily of red hairs with fair skin. The more you know.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jewelry Bonney – Australian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/One-Piece-Jewelry-Bonney.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>After the Straw Hats, we all have a favorite Supernova, and this is a safe space; you can admit it — it’s Bonney. Aside from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden surge of lore related to the youngest captain</a> in the high seas that came out in Egghead, we also discovered that Bonney hails from none other than Australia. Truth be told, we can perfectly envision her eating her way through all the seafood and meat restaurants in the sunny Aussie lands.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Basil Hawkins – Egyptian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Basil-Hawkins-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>Another Supernova that might surprise you with their nationality is none other than everyone’s favorite fortune-teller, Basil Hawkins. Apparently, Hawkins would be Egyptian if he were from our current Earth. Overall, this is quite unexpected, considering Oda based the pirate on not one, but two British pirates and privateers – so naturally, we would’ve guessed he was, at the very least, an English man. Nonetheless, the author has assured us that Hawkins would indeed come from Egypt.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Scratchmen Apoo – Chinese</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Basil-Hawkins.jpg><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>Perhaps it doesn’t come off as entirely surprising that Apoo would be living in China if he were a real human being. Truth be told, his overall appearance doesn’t necessarily make us think of any country – after all, Apoo’s animal resemblance is an orangutan. However, there is a very specific reason why he would be hailing from China, Apoo’s appearance and demeanor were inspired by the 19th-century Chinese pirate Chui A-poo, from his hair down to his clothes.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Capone Bege – Italian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bege-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>Yet another Supernova whose nationality isn’t entirely unexpected is Capone Bege. For starters, we’ve already covered that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bege’s namesake is Al Capone</a>, who — if you don’t know — was an American gangster and the son of Italian immigrants. Aside from that very obvious nod to Italy, Bege’s entire demeanor and appearance are based on the stereotypical Italian gangsters that are often depicted in fictional media. He’s a gentle gangster, though.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Urouge- Indian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Urouge-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>Yes, he may not have appeared in the story that much just yet, but Urouge is still quite an essential part of One Piece — especially as a Supernova. On that note, Oda has confirmed that Urouge would be Indian if he were real — which makes perfect sense. Urouge’s tan skin and dark hair are quite common features in the Eastern Asian country. What’s more, he is also the captain of the Monk Pirates and known for being the “Mad Monk” — a nod to both Hinduism and Buddhism.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Killer – Scottish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Killer-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Much like his captain, Killer is also from Scotland. According to Oda, both Kid and his right-hand man would be from the British Isles, and we can’t say we’re surprised. Kid and Killer are almost always by each other’s side, with Killer’s undying devotion to his captain being evident throughout the story. Considering this loyalty, it isn’t at all surprising that he would follow Kid to the ends of the earth, all the way from Scotland.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Trafalgar D. Law – German</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Law-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>You probably didn’t anticipate this, but Oda confirmed that Law would be of German origin. While Germans aren’t typically associated with being short, olive-skinned, or dark-haired, that’s the beauty of multiculturalism — we come in all shapes and sizes. Despite Law’s appearance not aligning with the stereotypical German look, his personality is what draws parallels to the Central European country. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He is efficient</a>, has a strong work ethic, and is incredibly direct.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Blackbeard – Somali</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blackbeard-one-piece1.jpg><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=false>According to the One Piece author, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the longest-lasting antagonists in the series</a> would hail from Somalia if Earth actually existed in the pirate world. It appears that Blackbeard would be from the East African country, much like Usopp. However, unlike Usopp, who is only described as being from Africa, Blackbeard was actually given the same treatment as everyone else on this list and finally received a specific country of origin – not just a continent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn56qlWKus7GMqKWeZaCesqSxjJyfmqqRmMGmvtJmnaunnWLBqbGMrKurmaditaLA0malmqyZpLuiuMitoJ6rXZ67bsDHnmSrnZGheri70aWbaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charles-ruggles.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charles Ruggles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./melyssa-ford.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Melyssa Ford Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!

The man’s been remarkably busy over the years, pivoting between massive television projects to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">work on various films</a>, serve as a spokesperson for the NRA, and somehow — even with his packed schedule — he still finds time for his family.</p><h2 id=h-tom-selleck-s-wife data-injectable=false>Tom Selleck’s wife</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tom-Selleck-family.jpg><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Selleck has been married twice</a> in his nearly 80 years on this earth, first to model&nbsp;Jacqueline Ray and later to his current wife, who he’s shared a life with for more than 35 years. Selleck married Ray in 1971 and, during the eleven years they were together, also adopted her young son, Kevin Shepard.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Following his first divorce, Selleck was single for a good few years, until he met his second and current wife, Jillie Joan Mack. The pair met while Selleck was at the peak of his fame, and while Mack was in the midst of a run as Rumpleteazer in Cats. He reportedly viewed the musical numerous times just to set sights on his to-be wife, and within a few months he’d won her heart. The pair married in August of 1987, and they’ve been happily wed ever since.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Mack made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">frequent appearances on Magnum, P.I.</a> during her husband’s tenure on the program, and that’s far from the only acting credit under her belt. Her resume isn’t nearly as decorated as her husband’s, but interested viewers can catch a glimpse of the star in series like ER and Frasier.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=false>Mack and Selleck also share a daughter together, who was born just over a year after they wed. Hannah’s a full-blown adult, these days, and works as a professional equestrian. Their family tends to keep their private life out of the spotlight, but the brief glimpses fans get reveal a cozy, content family with a clear focus on quality time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmrJ%2BierSxy6WcnKNdoq6zvsiem2asn2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./addison-riecke-bio-wiki-age-height-boyfriend-parents-movies-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Addison Riecke Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Parents, Movies and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stephen-sharer-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stephen Sharer Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rose-namajunas-lesbian-engaged-fiance-pat-barry.html>Rose Namajunas Is Not Lesbian!
